    "# Multi-Agent Belief Sharing Problem: Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve a simple multi-agent information-sharing planning problem using Spectra (SST_Prover + run_spectra).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain & Background\n",
    "- Domain objects: `a`, `b`, `c` (agents); `p1`, `p2` (rooms).\n",
    "- Background facts and axioms include:\n",
    "    - Agent/room declarations: `(agent a)`, `(agent b)`, `(agent c)`, `(room p1)`, `(room p2)`.\n",
    "    - Inequality/uniqueness: `(not (= a b))`, `(not (= a c))`, `(not (= b c))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actions\n",
    "Four parameterized actions are defined:\n",
    "- `left ?a` — move agent `?a` from `p2` to `p1` (precondition: at `p2`); effects update `(at ?a p1)` / `(not (at ?a p2))`.\n",
    "- `right ?a` — move agent `?a` from `p1` to `p2` (precondition: at `p1`); effects update `(at ?a p2)` / `(not (at ?a p1))`.\n",
    "- `shareboth ?a1 ?a2 ?a3 ?r` — when three distinct agents meet in room `?r`, `?a1` causes `?a2` and `?a3` to believe `the ?a1`, and `?a1` to believe that `?a2`/`?a3` believe `the ?a1`. Adds corresponding `Believes!` facts and removes their negations.\n",
    "- `sharesingle ?a1 ?a2 ?a3 ?r` — when `?a1` and `?a2` meet in `?r` (and `?a3` is not there), `?a1` causes `?a2` to believe `the ?a1` and `?a1` to believe that `?a2` believes `the ?a1`. Adds corresponding `Believes!` facts and removes their negations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each action encodes preconditions, addition effects, and deletion effects (including toggling negated belief facts).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial State and Goal\n",
    "- Initial state (`start`) includes agents at `p1`:\n",
    "    - `(at a p1)`, `(at b p1)`, `(at c p1)` (and corresponding `(not (at X p2))`), and initial belief facts like `(Believes! a (the a))`, `(Believes! b (the b))`, `(Believes! c (the c))` plus negated cross-beliefs.\n",
    "- Goal (`goal`):\n",
    "    - `(and (Believes! b (the a)) (Believes! a (Believes! b (the a))) (not (Believes! c (the a))))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan Found\n",
    "A plan of length 2 was found (sequence executed in order):\n",
    "1. `(right c)` — move agent `c` to `p2`.\n",
    "2. `(sharesingle a b c p1)` — `a` shares with `b` in `p1` while `c` is absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solver details: plan produced by `run_spectra(...)` using `SST_Prover`'s cached shadow prover."
